To further boost retinar and benefit the implementation of our solution, we're thrilled to announce that we're participating from the 2020 edition of [Prendete, the contest of innovative business ideas](https://www.prendete.com.ar/). Prendete is a national contest organized in Tandil since 2015, which aims to aid in the development of innovative initiatives and be a starting point for viable, scalable project that can generate more employments.

At retinar we believe in these initiatives as fundamental steps to connect the national community of entrepeneurs while bringing training on marketing and business management to make them grow towards bigger start-ups and tech companies. So here we are, very excited to be there for the first time!

We'll keep you updated about our latest news through [our official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/retinarARG), and of course here, too.
