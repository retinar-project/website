We're very excited to announce the launch of our website! This is yet another tool to keep you updated about our latest news. We make this site in a rush, while setting up everything to participate in [Prendete, the contest for innovative business ideas organized in Tandil](https://www.prendete.com.ar/). We're thrilled to see how far we can make it with retinar!

retinar is a joint initiative between [Yatiris team](https://yatiris.github.io/) from [PLADEMA](https://www.pladema.net/) and the Ophthalmology Service and Telmedicine Areas of [Hospital El Cruce](https://www.hospitalelcruce.org/). We want to develop a diagnostic platform for teleophthalmology based on artificial intelligence. If you want to know more, you can watch [our presentation video (in Spanish, though)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAPHBQcLNTo) in [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg2K_iT5S8UgA36ukvgxKhQ), or you can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/retinarARG) for the latest news.

retinar. Nice to see you again.
