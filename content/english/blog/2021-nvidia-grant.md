retinar was selected as member of the  NVIDIA Applied Research Accelerator Program. Our project, entitled "retinar: assisting remote diabetic retinopathy screening with AI tools", our joint initiative between UNICEN and Hospital El Cruce was awarded with 500 hours on V100 GPU instances via SaturnCloud. This donation can be extended to more hours, if the project requires it.

This award will help retinar to increase its productivity and develop our prototype much faster than with our current equipment. We are extremely thankful to NVIDIA Corporation for their support!
